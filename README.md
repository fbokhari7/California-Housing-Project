# California Housing Price Prediction

This repository contains a dataset and code for predicting housing prices in California using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes 20,640 observations of 10 variables, such as geographical location, housing characteristics, population, and income data. The code is written in Python using Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
